        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> I'm <b>Bodakonda Sravan Kumar</b>, currently pursuing my Master's degree in Computer Science at<b> Sacred Heart University</b>. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from <b>Lovely Professional University</b> , where I graduated with a commendable 75% grade. My journey in the field of technology has been both enriching and dynamic, characterized by a relentless pursuit of knowledge and a passion for innovation.

            During my professional tenure as a Salesforce Developer at<b></b> Wipro, I spent 1.5 years honing my skills and contributing to impactful projects. This experience not only provided me with hands-on expertise in Salesforce development but also instilled in me a deep understanding of the importance of leveraging technology to drive business success.
            
            One of the hallmarks of my career has been my commitment to continuous learning and growth. I have actively pursued and obtained three major certifications in the course of my work experience, each adding layers of proficiency and credibility to my skill set.
            
            I believe that technology is a catalyst for transformation, and I am driven by the prospect of exploring new technologies and embracing emerging trends in the ever-evolving landscape of computer science. I am eager to leverage my academic background, professional experience, and passion for learning to make meaningful contributions to the world of technology.</p>
